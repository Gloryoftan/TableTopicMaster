# TableTopicMaster
I wanna create a interactive slide to help me make a wonderful experence of my TTM.
I got only three days and i need to design everything.
So the "looking" thing became not that important.
But im still trying to make it more clear.
Thought i don't have a good ability to handle animation or beautify things.
I just wanna try my best to create new things.
